- 👋 Hi, I’m @lucyxzhang
- 👀 I’m interested in creating things, whether that's digitally or physically and figuring out how everything works together.
- 🌱 I’m going to college to be a mechatronics engineer, so I can work on all aspects of a project. I am currently focusing more of the software aspect of projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything. I have the most experience in C++, HTML, CSS, and Python with some experience in C#, Java, 
 Javascript, C, Assembly, VHDL, and Swift/SwiftUI.
- 📫 How to reach me: lucy2003zhang@outlook.com
